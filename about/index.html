<p>
	Hello, my name is Victor Lawrence. I have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts" target="_blank">BFA</a> from <a href="https://theatre.columbusstate.edu/" target="_blank">Columbus State University</a> in Theatrical Design and Technology and I like building stuff for the web. 
	I'm an Apprentice Software Engineer for a startup whose headquarters is located in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PrrVotiqdV42" target="_blank">New Haven, Connecticut</a>. 
	I help build new and helpful interfaces for our customers and employees to use.
</p>
<p>
	I am passionate about making things feel smooth, quick and intuitive. In other words, I want to build interfaces so good that you don't really notice them.
